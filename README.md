# Restaurant-Reservation-Management-System
This project aims to create a comprehensive restaurant dine-in and reservation management system to offer users a seamless experience when interacting with various restaurant-related services. It provides a structured approach to data storage and retrieval for all entities involved in the restaurant business. At a high level, the system allows customers to place dine-in orders and make restaurant reservations, while the restaurants can also track customer orders and reservations.

### For MySQL:
● Use MySQL Workbench to import the Database Schema and the Database
Dump. Run the SQL .sql file titled ‘KoppoluSSenthilkumarK_dump’. This dump includes the creation of sample data - including a customer account and some placed orders.

### For Application:
● Install the following Python Libraries: pymysql, pandas, datetime
Run the command “pip install pymysql” in the terminal to install pymysql Run the command “pip install pandas” in the terminal to install pandas Run the command “pip install datetime” in the terminal to install datetime
● Preferably use VS Code as the IDE
● Run the application ‘user_application.py’ and you will first be prompted to
connect to the Database using the appropriate login credentials to access the localhost server in MySQL in your system. Thereafter, you will again be prompted for a username - this is the username for a customer account. Since a first-time user of the application will not have a customer account, you will be prompted to create a customer account with a unique username.
● The application ‘user_application.py’ can be run within the IDE or via the terminal using the command ‘python user_application.py’. In case you are running the application via the terminal, make sure you are in the same directory as that of the ‘user_application.py’ file.
